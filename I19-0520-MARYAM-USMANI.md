Q1) Explain Docker Containers vs VMs
Ans- VM can act as computer inside your computer having its own OS. They are huge in size 100s of GBs. VMs are good to use if you have independant applications. On the other hand, Docker Containers use the host computer's OS and share it, this way its not that heavy on the resources. This packs the apps and their dependancies which makes it very easy to use across multiple enviornements.
