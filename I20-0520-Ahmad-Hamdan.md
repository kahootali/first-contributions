Docker Containers:
Isolation: OS-level, shares host OS kernel.
Efficiency: Lightweight, minimal overhead.
Speed: Fast start and stop, seconds.
Dependency: Encapsulates app and dependencies.
Deployment: Image-based, highly portable.

Virtual Machines (VMs):
Isolation: Hardware-level, complete OS.
Efficiency: Heavier, more resource overhead.
Speed: Slower start, higher resource use.
Dependency: Encapsulates complete OS stack.
Deployment: Image-based, less portable.

In essence, Docker containers are lightweight, share the host OS kernel, and start quickly, while VMs are heavier, run complete operating systems, and start more slowly. Containers are great for efficiency and portability, while VMs offer stronger isolation. Choose based on your specific use case and requirements.
