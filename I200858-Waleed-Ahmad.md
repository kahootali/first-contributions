A VM (Virtual machine) is a complete machine and has all of it's own resources. Both docker container and VMs are used for running isolated environments. Docker containers are lightweight, share the host OS kernel, and provide efficient resource utilization, making them ideal for microservices, cloud-native applications, and DevOps environments. They offer portability and scalability. In contrast, virtual machines (VMs) are heavier, run separate OS instances, and provide stronger isolation, making them better suited for legacy applications and scenarios requiring high security. The choice between containers and VMs depends on specific use cases and requirements, with many organizations using both to leverage their respective advantages.
