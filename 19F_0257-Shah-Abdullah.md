Q1) Explain Docker Containers vs VMs?

Solution:

1. Docker Containers
* They are light weight as compared to VMs.
* They use host OS kernel.
* They are more efficient in terms of resource utilization as they does not requires full OS.
* Containers are highly resource efficient and start up quickly.
* Each container has its own file sytem.
* Containers are highly portable.

2. VMs
* VMs would run on full OS stack including the kernel which makes the heavier.
* VMs are more resource intensive.
* Vms provide stronger isolation because they emulte separate hardware.
* Every VM has its own kernel and resources making it more secure and suitable for running.
* Vms are less portable as compared to conainers.

Q2) Write command to create a docker container in detached mode with name assignment-2-<ROLL_NUMBER> running on host port 9090 and container port 80 using image nginx with version 1.24.0 on a custom network named assignment-2

Solution:

docker run -d --name assignment-2-19F_0257
-p 9090:80
--network assignemnt_02
nginx:1.24.0

Q3) Run the above command and add screenshot of it and share the logs
