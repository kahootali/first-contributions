1. Docker containers are lightweight compared to virtual machines because each container shares the host's operating system. This automatically allows containers to have a quick startup because the operating system kernel is already loaded and does not need to be loaded everytime unlike in VMs which are heavyweight because each VM includes a full guest operating system and the startup for a VM takes long because the entire operating system needs to be loaded. Virtual Machines are less portable because of the difference in the virtualization technologies while containers are comparatively more portable because the libraries and dependencies needed for an application to run are all included within the contain. Lastly, containers perform isolation on a process level while VMs perform isolation on a hardware-level level. 

2. docker run -d --name assignment-2-I20-0582 -p 9090:80 --network assignment-2 nginx:1.24.0
