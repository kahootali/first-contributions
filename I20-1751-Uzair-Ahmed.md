Q1, Docker Vs Vms
Docker containers are lightweight, share the host OS kernel, and are ideal for microservices and portable applications due to their efficiency and 
quick startup times. Virtual Machines (VMs) emulate complete operating systems, providing stronger isolation but at the cost of higher resource utilization 
and slower boot times. Docker is preferred for modern, resource-efficient, and portable workloads, while VMs are chosen when stricter isolation or running 
legacy applications is necessary.
