Question 1: Explain Docker Containers vs VM

Docker Container:
    Containers are OS level virtualized environments to run applications. They come with application, requried binaries and their own OS. They share the kernel of the host OS. Containers run as processes on host OS. The have burstable memory which can increase or decrease according to the need. Docker is a provider which provides containers technology and the container of Docker are called Docker containers.

VMs:
    Virtual Machines are hardware level virtualized environments. They have a fixed memory and storage. VMs comes with their own OS and kernel. To run an application on VMs, application and dependencies are installed manually. When required, their memory and storage is expanded manually.


Question 2:
    Command = docker run -d --name assignment-2-I19-2195 -p 9090:80 --network assignment-2 nginx:1.24.0

    This command runs an nginx container named assignment2-I19-2195 on host port 80 in a network named assignment-2
