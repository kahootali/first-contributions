# Q1.

- VMS take a longer time to run compared to containers which are quicker to run
- VM uses a lot of system memory while containers use less system memory
- VMs are more secure as underlying hardware is not shared while it is containers hence not as secure
- VMs are the better choice when we require all of the OS resources while containers are useful when we are required to max the running apps using minimal servers.
- VMs are generally larger in size than containers
