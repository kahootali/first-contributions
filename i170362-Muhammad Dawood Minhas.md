Q1- Docker containers are lightweight, application-level virtualization units that share the host OS kernel. 
They offer resource efficiency, portability, and fast startup times.
Virtual machines (VMs) are heavier, hardware-level virtualization units that emulate entire operating systems. 
They provide strong isolation but consume more resources and have slower startup times.

Q2- docker run -d --name assignment-2-<i170362> -p 9090:80 --network assignment-2 nginx:1.24.0
