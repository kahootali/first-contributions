VMware and Docker serve different purposes in virtualization and containerization. VMware creates virtual machines (VMs) with complete OS stacks, offering strong isolation but with higher resource overhead. Docker, in contrast, uses containers, sharing the host OS kernel for efficiency. Containers are highly portable and quick to start, making them suitable for modern, cloud-native applications, while VMware is often chosen for legacy apps or scenarios needing strong isolation. The choice depends on specific use cases and requirements.
